flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - images/splash_bg@2x.png
   - images/splash_hdr@2x.png
   - images/image_placeholder.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Google Sans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/googlesans/GoogleSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/googlesans/GoogleSans-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/googlesans/GoogleSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/googlesans/GoogleSans-MediumItalic.ttf
          weight: 500
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/googlesans/GoogleSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/googlesans/GoogleSans-BoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 700
          style: italic
    - family: Roboto

        - asset: fonts/roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf

          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/roboto/Roboto-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/roboto/Roboto-MediumItalic.ttf
          weight: 500
          style: italic
